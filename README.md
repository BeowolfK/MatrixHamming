### Error correcting codes and matrices (example of the Hamming code) : how to code via a matrix?

This code is for a math project.

Work in groups of 1, 2, 3 or 4 maximum :

- 1 tutorial video by group.
- Minimum duration: 2min.
- All the people who are in the group must participate (we must hear everyone in turn, with 4 people it's 30 seconds each minimum).
- It will take a python or Matlab program to write or comment and test for each video.
- Video to put on a deposit then copy the link.
